# Tubes Aljabar Linear & Geometri 1

This is our first project that maintained by 3 people :
* Hana Fathiyah - 13520047
* Bayu Samudra - 13520128
* Febryola Kurnia Putri - 13520140

## What is This Project About?
we made this project in order to fill the requirements of Linear and Geometric Algebra class in ITB
informatic engineering. this project consist of several features:

* Linear equation
* Determinan
* Matrix Inverse
* Polynomial Interpolation
* Bilinier Regression

Note : All the features above can read and write test cases either in file or console.

## The Process
This Project was made under several conditions:
* Using Java SE Runtime Environment (JDK 17 version and JRE)
* Using Maven 3.8.2 to automate build the program
* Created using intelliJ idea (new version)

## Folder Structure
* github: contains workflow
* idea: contains file xml (.xml) for IntelliJ Idea configuration
* bin: contains java byte code (.class) and jar file of the program
* doc: contains pdf file of this project (.pdf)
* src/tubes/algeo: contains source code (.java)
* test: contains file testing (.java) and case study input.
